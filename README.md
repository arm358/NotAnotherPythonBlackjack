# Not Another Python Blackjack
##### Okay.... it's another Python Blackjack game. You've seen many of these before (I'm sure). But this one includes betting!

### *Prerequisites*
Nothing fancy, no 3rd party libraries necessary. 

### *Usage*
1. `python3 blackjack.py`
2. Enter names of all players separated by a comma
3. Enter number of decks to play with
4. Good luck!

### *Notes*
- Starting credits for each player is 10, unless you already had credits saved from previous plays. In this case, 10 credits are added to your existing total.
- Dealer stays on soft 17
- Getting natural blackjack (first two cards) pays 2x bet -- no matter the dealer's hand.
- Game ends when there is <25% of original deck left, or all players are broke
